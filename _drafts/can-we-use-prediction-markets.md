## But won't this be slow??

Thank you, good question. This is a question about trying to predict the future. Which is something you definitely should try to do! (Maybe set up some [prediction markets](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/prediction-market-faq)?) But it's hard, and you should do it realistically and think about what you _really_ need in the near future.
