title:  "Writing a habit tracker, part 28: Summary so far"
---

I have written twenty-seven little posts in the series called Writing a Habit Tracker! I'm pretty happy about that! 

It's not like we have implemented a lot of functionality. But we have discussed a whole bunch of stuff. 

* In part one, I introduced the project, which I named `hahabit`, and proceeded to set up some software on my Digital Ocean Ubuntu machine: PostgreSQL and Java 19. 
* In part two, I created a Spring Boot app using Spring Initializr, and discussed what components to use. 
* In part three, I set up Testcontainers so that we could run the test suite. 
* In part four, I wrote a functionality spec for `hahabit` and create an initial PostgreSQL schema for users with the help of ChatGPT. 
* In part five, I created a Spring Data JDBC repository for users, again using ChatGPT. 
* In part six, I discussed some details about Spring Data JDBC and records, improved on the user model and added a table and repository for habits. 
* In part seven, I added the table that tracks the achievements, i.e. when you mark a habit as having been "done" for a specific day. 
* In part eight, I started configuring Spring MVC, decided I would serve web pages directly from Spring using Thymeleaf and set up a docker-compose file to run the service locally. 
* In part nine, I explored how the basic Spring Security setup works using `curl`, when it redirects to a form login and when it just challenges with Basic auth.   
* In part ten,
* In part eleven,
* In part twelve,
* In part thirteen,
* In part fourteen,
* In part fifteen,
* In part sixteen,
* In part seventeen,
* In part eighteen,
* In part nineteen,
* In part twenty,
* In part twenty-one,
* In part twenty-two,
* In part twenty-three,
