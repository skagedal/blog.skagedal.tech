Now I'll just get right on writing... what exactly? Hmm. Now might be a good time to discuss what functionality we really want for this thing to support.

## Brief functionality spec

As a user, I should be able to:
* Create a daily habit. We only support daily habits. Each habit has a description, and each habit gets an identifier.
* Probably edit and delete those habits as well, the whole CRUD deal.
* Mark a habit as having been completed for a certain day.
* List some stats of when the habit was completed.

That's pretty much it for now.
