title:  "Submitting a bug to Testcontainers about Colima"
---

I bet you thought that today's post was going to continue on [yesterday's](/2023/01/31/test-containers-and-docker-context.html) exploration on making Docker Context work. But no! 

Instead I spent today's allotted time for hobby hacking on [submitting a bug](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/6450) regarding one of the other issues that I mentioned in the [first post in the series](/2023/01/30/test-containers-and-colima.html), after I happened to [discuss it on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@skagedal/109779689243289903) with one of the fine maintainers of Testcontainers.

I will definitely keep you, fine readers of the "skagedal's oboy" blog, updated on this topic!
