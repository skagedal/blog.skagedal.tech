I enjoy programming. I do it for a living, and sometimes I do it on my spare time. Those activities tend to feed in 
to each other, in that I like to play with the technologies I use at work in my spare time, but with some kind of 
twist that I want to explore. 

So, when I was an iOS programmer, I would do various iOS and Swift hobby projects, then I primarily worked with Java 
and Kotlin for a while and fooled around with that. Now recently, work life has mostly brought me into the 
JavaScript ecosystem.  So that's what I'm toying with now. 

Often, what I'll want to do is some kind of CLI tool for myself â€“ the shell is where I live and breathe.  


I go to [nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org).

I'll run 

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest
```
