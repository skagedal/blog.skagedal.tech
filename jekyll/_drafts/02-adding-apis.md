title:  "Hahabit: Adding API:s"
summary: "I discuss adding API:s to the habit tracker"
---
So, I'm pretty happy with the test coverage that we have worked now for a few post. I looked at what those remaining 10% consisted of, and did not deem them interesting enough to spend time writing tests for. Let's continue with other stuff.  

I want to add some new kinds of user experiences for Hahabit. I'm not all that happy with server-generated HTML. Eventually, I might consider either writing an iOS app, or a web app that uses React, or something entirely different. Either way, I'll want some API:s.

To begin with, the API:s will reflect the current functionality of the web app. I'm going to start with writing some tests.

What's nice with doing the TDD thing of writing the tests first for API:s is that you get to think about the API:s from the client's point of view, how they're supposed to be used, before you write them.

I'm creating a new class called `ApiTests` and copy a whole bunch of boilerplate code from `WebTests`. Some day for sure I'll try to neaten things up a bit. 

To get going, here's my first test:

```java
public class ApiTests {
    // ...
    
    @Test
    void create_habit() {
        final var username = testDataManager.createRandomUser();

        final var response = send(
            POST(
                uri("/api/habits"),
                """
                   {
                       "description": "Go for a walk",
                   }
                """
            )
                .header("Authorization", testDataManager.authHeader(username))
                .build());

        assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
    }

    // ...
}
```

We should figure out something more proper for the API authentication later, but for now I think Basic Auth will do. So, that `testDataManager.authHeader(String userName)` function is just this:

```java
public class TestDataManager {
    // ...
    public String authHeader(String username) {
        return "Basic " + base64Encoder.encodeToString((username + ":" + PASSWORD).getBytes());
    }
    // ...
}
```

I currently don't have Basic Auth enabled in Spring Security, only form authentication. So the above test fails like this:

```
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: 
expected: 200
 but was: 302
 ```

It's directing everyone to the login form. Let's add Basic Auth:

```java
public class WebSecurityConfig {
    // ...
    
    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests(requests -> requests
                .requestMatchers("/actuator/*").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .formLogin(Customizer.withDefaults())
            // ðŸ‘‡ I now just added this line
            .httpBasic();

        return http.build();
    }
}
```

Now I expect my authentication to work, but as I haven't implemented the API yet, I should get a 404!

```
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: 
expected: 200
 but was: 401
 ```

Hmm no, now I get a [401](https://http.cat/401), Unauthorized. Did I mess up my Basic Auth header somehow? I don't think I did. I see nothing relevant in the service logs. I'd like to get more logs please. 

I think I'll do that by adding a little `dev` profile for myself, an `application-dev.properties` file in resources:

```properties
logging.level.org.springframework.security=DEBUG
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
``` 

Running my tests now with the `-Dspring.profiles.active=dev` flag in the VM arguments, I see this in the logs:

```

o.s.security.web.csrf.CsrfFilter         : Invalid CSRF token found for http://127.0.0.1:51295/api/habits

```

Allright, so the first part of this at least makes sense! I have protection for [cross-site request forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) (CSRF) enabled, and I'm not sending a CSRF token. The rest of the output is confusing; it says it's responding with a 403 but I clearly see a 401 as the end result of the call?  

Anyway, let's just deal with the CSRF stuff. I don't think this is relevant to have enabled for the API.[^1] I'll disable it:

```java
public class WebSecurityConfig {
    // ...
    
    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            // ðŸ‘‡ Adding these lines
            .csrf().ignoringRequestMatchers(request ->
                request.getRequestURI().startsWith("/api"))
            .and()
            // ðŸ‘† 
            .authorizeHttpRequests(requests -> requests
                .requestMatchers("/actuator/*").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .formLogin(Customizer.withDefaults())
            .httpBasic();

        return http.build();
    }
}
```

Now I get my expected [404](https://http.cat/404), Not Found!

```
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:
expected: 200
but was: 404
```

I did some manual tests to confirm that CSRF is still enabled as expected in the web pages. 

However, I now notice that another test is failing â€“ this one:

```java
public class WebTests {
    // ...
    @Test
    void home_redirects_to_login() {
        final var response = send(GET(uri("/")).build());

        assertThat(response.statusCode())
            .isEqualTo(HttpStatus.FOUND.value()); // that's a 302 redirect
        assertThat(response.headers().firstValue("Location"))
            .isPresent()
            .hasValue(uri("/login").toString());
    }
    // ...
}
```

We no longer get a 302 here, but a 401. However, as I test the app locally and connect through the browser, I can confirm that the redirect is working as expected there. This is exactly the behavior I described [back in part nine](/2023/01/09/habit-tracker-securing-things.html). I still want to know what it is that causes this difference. It seems that also HtmlUnit is getting the redirect, so it's doing whatever browsers are doing.  

I went so far as to [write a question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75511353/how-does-spring-determine-whether-to-redirect-to-form-login/75511354#75511354), and then, when I was writing the question I took a look again at the headers that the browsers were sending (again, see [part nine](/2023/01/09/habit-tracker-securing-things.html)) and had a face-palm moment. I had overlooked a very basic thing: the `Accept` header. So, with `Accept: text/html`, we get the redirect; with `Accept: */*`, we get the 401. 

I'm going to encode this knowledge into the test suite. I'm moving the test to `ApiTests` so that `WebTests` only deals with the HtmlUnit tests and `ApiTests` is the one doing direct HTTP calls. Then I break it into these two:

```java
public class ApiTests {
    // ...

    @Test
    void apis_get_unauthorized_response() {
        final var response = send(GET(uri("/")).build());

        assertThat(response.statusCode())
            .isEqualTo(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED.value());
        assertThat(response.headers().firstValue("WWW-Authenticate"))
            .isPresent()
            .hasValueSatisfying(value -> assertThat(value).startsWith("Basic"));
    }

    @Test
    void home_redirects_to_login_in_browsers() {
        final var responseAcceptingHtml = send(GET(uri("/")).header("Accept", "text/html").build());

        assertThat(responseAcceptingHtml.statusCode())
            .isEqualTo(HttpStatus.FOUND.value()); // that's a 302 redirect
        assertThat(responseAcceptingHtml.headers().firstValue("Location"))
            .isPresent()
            .hasValue(uri("/login").toString());
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Cool! I mean, actually, not sure this is the behavior I want â€“ I'd like to just have the form login protect the web endpoints and basic auth protect the API endpoints. But Spring Security setup is confusing to me. I'll need to dig deeper into it later, because also I don't want basic auth at all. 

Now I'd like to write some API:s!
