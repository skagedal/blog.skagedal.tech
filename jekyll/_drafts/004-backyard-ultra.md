There is a kind of ultra marathon called a Backyard Ultra. It works like this. Every hour a new lap starts.You need to finish the lap within the hour. The person who runs the most laps wins. (Actually, in order to win you need to complete one more lap than everybody else – or you will be marked as "DNF", "did not finish").  Each lap is 6.7 km, or xx miles – if you complete 24 laps, i.e run for 24 hours, you have run 100 miles. 

I was in the mood for a random little web project, when my brother-in-law mentioned something that he thought should exist in the world: a timer for a Backyard Ultra race. This would be something that the race organizer has on display somewhere near the starting line. It should give sound signals at specific points every hour: three whistle blows at three minutes before each lap, two whistle blows at two minutes before each lap, one whistle blow one minute before each lap and finally a bell should ring when the lap starts.
