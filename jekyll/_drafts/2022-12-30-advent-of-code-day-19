title:  "Advent of Code 2022 day 19"
---
I've been enjoying Advent of Code this year and solved each problem on the day of publishing up until day 18. It does
get trickier (and more time consuming) as december goes on. But later I also solve day 20 and 21, and now I really want
to solve the remaining ones to get that satisfying feeling of closure.

So, let's attack day 19. I thought I'd do that by blogging.

This problem is about some mineral collecting robots. We are to compare a set of blueprints, which describe how much
each robot costs, and what mineral it produces. By buying one kind of robot, you create minerals with which you can
buy other robots, and then the end goal is to produce _geodes_.
