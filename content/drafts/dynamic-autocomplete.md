* There is an [issue](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1232) for the Rust Clap package to add support for dynamic completion.
* Depends on [this issue](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3166).
  * Apparently, the Go package [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) allows for dynamic autocomplete. 
  * And also the Python [argcomple](https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/) package.
